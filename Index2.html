       Mama, you’ve always been someone I look up to and respect deeply. Your wisdom, patience, and sense of humor make every moment around you meaningful. You have a natural way of guiding and supporting others without ever making them feel pressured, and that says a lot about the kind of person you are. On your birthday, I hope you take a moment to realize how much you’re appreciated and admired. May this year bring you good health, peace of mind, and countless reasons to smile — you truly deserve it.
